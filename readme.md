# Matplotlib Learning Log

This folder documents my **foundational learning of Matplotlib**, focused on understanding how to **visualize data clearly and correctly**, not on advanced styling or presentation-level plots.

The goal was to learn **what to plot, when to plot it, and how to interpret it**, rather than mastering every customization option.

## What I covered

I practiced the most commonly used plot types that appear in real-world data analysis and machine learning workflows:

- Line plots for trends and relationships
- Scatter plots for understanding relationships between variables
- Bar charts for categorical comparisons
- Pie charts (for basic familiarity)
- Histograms for distribution analysis
- Multiple datasets on the same plot for comparison
- Proper use of:
  - labels
  - titles
  - legends
  - grids

These examples focus on **data meaning and readability**, not visual decoration.

## What this learning was focused on

- Choosing the right plot for the data type
- Understanding what each plot communicates
- Comparing datasets visually
- Supporting exploratory data analysis (EDA)

The emphasis was on **correct usage and interpretation**, not advanced styling, animations, or publication-quality visuals.
